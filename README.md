# Loop Studios Landing Page 🖼️

This is the first Frontend Mentor challenge I've made. The idea is to create a landing page as similar as possible to the design I was given (You can find it in the Design folder). Even though I used create-react-app boilerplate, there was no need to do it, since It was made with pure HTML and CSS, only for where I had to map Loop Studios' creations.
